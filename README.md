## Summary

Deep learning algorithms are widely used in various fields, such as computer vision. Computer vision allows the computer to "see" and do things like identify specific objects in an image, or classify images according to their content.
This project is about image classification. More specifically, the aim is to identify the breed of a cat in an image. To achieve this classifier, a customized convolutional neural network will be created. Transfer learning will then be performed. Among all existing models, three will be explored: MobileNet, VGG, Xception and EfficientNet.

## Dataset

This dataset used comes from Kaggle website. It is available here : [Cat Breeds Refined Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doctrinek/catbreedsrefined-7k).
